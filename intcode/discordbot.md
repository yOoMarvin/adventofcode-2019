## Intcode Discord Bot

I've found a super handy tool for the intcode puzzles! You can just invite a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) Bot to your Server, which will work as some kind of intcode vm.
You can invite the bot via [this link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=653389730813313031&permissions=124992&scope=bot).

Type `!intcode help` to get help.

Visit the [repo](https://github.com/andrerfcsantos/intcode-discord-bot) if you want further info.
